genefer 25.04.0 => genefer 25.05.0

Improvements
 - new unified GPU transform: two or three 31-bit or 32-bit primes

------------------------------------

genefer 24.04.0 => genefer 25.04.0

Improvements
 - faster GPU transform: vectors of four 32-bit integers for I/O

------------------------------------

genefer 23.07.0 => genefer 24.04.0

Improvements
 - faster GPU transforms
 - check error for GFN-22 on CPU

------------------------------------

genefer 23.01.0 => genefer 23.07.0

New Features
 - a deterministic test is implemented [-e]

Improvements
 - GPU transforms are based on Montgomery modular multiplication

------------------------------------

genefer 22.12.2 => genefer 23.01.0

New Features
 - new CPU transform for n = 17. The CPU limit is b_max > 1G
 - cyclo can be generated: test numbers of the form Phi_6(b^{2^n})

------------------------------------

genefer22 22.11.4 => genefer 22.12.2

Caveats
 - genefer22 is now genefer version year.month.release
 - if the validation fails then exit code is EXIT_CHILD_FAILED (was BOINC_SUCCESS)

New Features
 - Gerbicz-Li error checking of the proof task (-c)
 - new CPU transform for n <= 16. The CPU limit is b_max = 2G

Fixes
 - double close on file I/O error
 - read old checkpoint if the current one is invalid
 - send Boinc trickle
 - warning "#threads > 64"
 - warning "implementation is not valid", was an error

Improvements
 - success-failed-aborted logic is propagated, exit(0) were removed
